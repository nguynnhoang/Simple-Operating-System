# Simple-Operating-System
GOAL: The objective of this assignment is the simulation of major components in a simple operating system,
for example, scheduler, synchronization, related operations of physical memory and virtual memory.

IN DETAILS: Create and practice with three major modules: scheduler, synchronization, mechanism
of memory allocation from virtual-to-physical memory.
